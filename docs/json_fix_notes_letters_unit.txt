Korean Writing App — JSON Correction Notes (Letters Unit)
===============================================================

Context
-------
This file records known minor data issues in the JSON files for the 글자 단원 (Letters Unit),
to be fixed in a future app update (e.g., version 1.0.1 or later).

Issue #1 — Misplaced Syllable in Letters Unit
---------------------------------------------
Type: Content placement error (NOT a JSON syntax error)
Status: Known, does NOT break app execution

Description (to be filled by author):
- A specific Hangul syllable (글자) in the 글자 단원 JSON is placed in the wrong position.
- It appears in a different set/sequence than intended.

Details (fill in when convenient):
- JSON file name  : ______________________________
- Section / set ID: ______________________________
- Wrong entry     : ______________________________
- Correct location: ______________________________

User Impact
-----------
- The app runs normally. There is no crash or parsing error.
- Learners may see one 글자 in an unexpected position within the sequence.
- Educational impact is minimal and acceptable for version 1.0.0.

Decision
--------
- The current 1.0.0 release will NOT be delayed because of this small issue.
- This is treated as a minor “옥의 티” (small imperfection) in the initial release.
- The correction will be included in the next maintenance update.

Planned Fix Version
-------------------
- Target version: 1.0.1 (or the first minor update after initial release)
- Planned actions:
  1) Identify the exact JSON file and array where the 글자 is misplaced.
  2) Move the 글자 to the correct position in the array.
  3) Run a quick regression test for the 글자 단원.
  4) Rebuild Android/iOS/Windows release builds.
  5) Submit updated builds to the app stores as version 1.0.x.

Release Notes Template
----------------------
When the fix is applied, you can use the following line in the official release notes:

- [Fix] Corrected a misplaced Hangul syllable in the Letters Unit JSON data.
